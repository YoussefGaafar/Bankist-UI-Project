### 💡 Inspired by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman)

**Bankist** is a sleek, minimalist banking website that I created to showcase modern JavaScript techniques while delivering a seamless user experience. This project emphasizes clean UI/UX design with functional components developed in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📄 Project Overview
This project includes a range of interactive and dynamic features:
- 🌐 **Smooth Scrolling**: Effortless transitions to each section.
- 📌 **Sticky Navbar**: Navbar stays accessible as you scroll through the site.
- 🖼️ **Lazy Loading Images**: Optimized loading for a faster experience.
- 🗂️ **Tabbed Component**: Displays different banking operations with a simple click.
- 🎞️ **Slider Component**: A responsive testimonial slider with keyboard navigation support.
- 📝 **Modal for Signup**: Opens a form for account registration, featuring overlay effects for added focus.
- ⚡ **Responsive Event Delegation**: Streamlined event management to keep the site highly responsive.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: 📜 Semantic markup for structured content.
- **CSS3**: 🎨 Styling with custom properties and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: ⚙️ Interactive components, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous event handling.

## 🌟 Key Features & Functionalities
### 1. 🌐 **Smooth Scrolling**
   - JavaScript-powered smooth scrolling to improve navigation experience.

### 2. 🎯 **Event Delegation for Efficient Navigation**
   - Event delegation on the navbar for better performance and cleaner code.

### 3. 🗂️ **Tabbed Component**
   - Tabbed navigation for accessing banking operations, dynamically highlighting active tabs and displaying associated content.

### 4. 🖼️ **Lazy Loading Images**
   - Lazy loading functionality for images, where low-resolution images are displayed initially and swapped out for high-res versions when scrolled into view.

### 5. 📌 **Sticky Navigation Bar**
   - Uses the Intersection Observer API for an efficient, performant sticky navbar.

### 6. 🎞️ **Image Slider with Dots and Keyboard Navigation**
   - Responsive slider for testimonials, controlled by buttons, dots, or arrow keys.

### 7. 📝 **Modal Window for Sign-Up**
   - Modal with overlay effects for enhanced user engagement and focus on registration.

## 📂 Project Structure

📦 **bankist**  
 ┣ 📂 **img** Contains Images and icons  
 ┣ 📜 **index.html** Main HTML structure  
 ┣ 📜 **style.css** Stylesheet for the website  
 ┗ 📜 **script.js** JavaScript for interactive components

## ⚙️ Optimized Script Loading
The JavaScript in this project is loaded with `defer`, ensuring that scripts execute only after the HTML has been fully parsed, which improves performance and reduces page load times.

## ✨ Additional Highlights
- **Intersection Observer API**: Efficient for sticky navigation and revealing elements on scroll.
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: ⌨️ Added for slider navigation to enhance accessibility.

## 📖 Acknowledgments
This project was created as part of a learning journey and is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann’s exceptional JavaScript course and design principles.
